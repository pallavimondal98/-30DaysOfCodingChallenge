-------------Type Casting: 
                Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another. 
                It's necessary when you want to perform operations on variables or values of different data types. 
                For example, converting a string to an integer or vice versa.

------------Closure: 
                    A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer scope even if they are not present 
                    in memory. In JavaScript, closures are often used to create private variables and encapsulate functionality.

-----------var and const: 
                These are variable declaration keywords in JavaScript. var is used to declare variables with function scope
                 (or global if declared outside functions), while const is used to declare constants with block scope. 
                 Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are initialized.
                
------------Loops: 
                Loops are control structures used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specific condition is met. 
                Here are some common types:

                    for: A loop that runs for a specific number of iterations.

                    foreach (in the context of arrays): A loop used to iterate over elements in an array.

                    for...of: A loop used to iterate over iterable objects (like arrays or strings) to access their values.

                    for...in: A loop used to iterate over the properties of an object.

------------Scope (Lexical): 
                Lexical scope, also known as static scope, is a scope determined by the placement of variables and blocks 
                in the source code during the compilation phase. Variables declared within a block are accessible within 
                that block and its nested blocks.

------------Type Conversion:
                Type conversion, also known as type coercion, is the process of converting values from one data type 
                to another in a programming language. In JavaScript, this can happen implicitly (automatically) or 
                explicitly (manually) using functions like parseInt(), parseFloat(), or by using operators like Number(), 
                String(), etc.
